# PROJECT-F4-GROUP-5

# Introduction
This project focuses on applying natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze textual data derived from restaurant reviews. NLP is a critical area within artificial intelligence that enables machines to comprehend, interpret, and generate human language. With the exponential growth of text data across various platforms, the need for effective NLP solutions is paramount. The primary objective of this project is to harness machine learning models, particularly advanced deep learning architectures such as transformers, to extract meaningful insights from text data.

The project aims to analyze user-generated reviews to predict outcomes such as sentiment and star ratings based on the content of the reviews. By systematically gathering, cleaning, and analyzing the data, this project illustrates the end-to-end process involved in building a robust NLP solution.

# Dataset Description
The project utilizes two primary datasets, each of which is integral to understanding and modeling the problem.

## Restaurants Dataset
This dataset contains comprehensive information about various restaurants, which serves as a reference for their details and associated reviews. The columns included in this dataset are:

business_id: A unique identifier for each restaurant.

name: The name of the restaurant.

location: The geographical location of the restaurant.

cuisine: The type of cuisine served at the restaurant.

rating: The average rating based on user reviews.

price_range: The price range of the restaurant, indicating its affordability.

review_count: The total number of reviews submitted for the restaurant.

latitude: The latitude of the restaurant's location.

longitude: The longitude of the restaurant's location.

## Reviews Dataset
This dataset comprises user-generated reviews for the restaurants, providing valuable textual data for analysis. The columns included in this dataset are:

review_id: A unique identifier for each review.

business_id: A foreign key linking the review to the corresponding restaurant.

user_id: A unique identifier for the user who wrote the review.

text: The content of the review, expressing the user's experience and opinions.

stars: The rating given by the user, typically ranging from 1 to 5.

date: The date the review was submitted.

helpful_votes: The number of users who found the review helpful.

total_votes: The total number of votes the review received, including helpful and unhelpful votes.

These datasets are combined to perform a comprehensive analysis and modeling, with textual reviews serving as input for NLP models and ratings acting as the output or target variables.

# Installation and Setup
To run this project locally, several dependencies and tools are required. First and foremost, Python 3.7 or higher is essential. Additionally, this project utilizes an SQLite database to store and efficiently query data during training and evaluation.

# Steps to Set Up the Project:
Clone the Repository: Clone the project repository from GitHub.
Install Dependencies: All required Python packages are specified in the requirements.txt file. Install these packages to ensure that all necessary libraries are available.
Set Up the Database: An SQLite database is utilized to manage the data. A provided script facilitates the initial setup of the database.
Once the environment is established, users can proceed to explore the data and train models.

# Usage
The project is structured into several key components, including scripts and Jupyter notebooks that facilitate both automated execution and interactive exploration.

1. Data Preprocessing: This phase involves cleaning and preparing the data for modeling. Tasks include removing duplicates, handling missing values, tokenizing text, and vectorizing it using various techniques.

2. Model Training: The project supports different modeling approaches, including traditional models such as logistic regression and advanced models like transformer-based architectures. Users can specify the type of model to be trained and the number of epochs for training.

3. Model Evaluation: After training, models can be evaluated using another script that loads the trained model and applies it to a test set. Various metrics, such as accuracy and F1-score, are generated to assess model performance.

# Modeling Approach
This project employs both traditional machine learning techniques and state-of-the-art NLP models. Initial baseline models, such as logistic regression and random forest, help establish a benchmark. These rely on basic text preprocessing techniques and representations. For more sophisticated analysis, advanced deep learning models like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and transformer models (such as BERT) are implemented. These models utilize advanced text embeddings to capture the nuances of language found within the reviews.
The project explores several methodologies, including:

a) Text preprocessing techniques such as tokenization and stop-word removal.

b) Vectorization methods, including TF-IDF and deep embeddings like BERT.

c) A comparative approach that assesses the effectiveness of various models against one another.

# Results
The project evaluates models using various performance metrics. For classification tasks, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-scores are the primary measures of interest. Each model's performance is carefully analyzed, highlighting strengths and weaknesses through detailed results presented in tables and graphs. Preliminary findings indicate that while traditional models perform adequately, advanced models such as BERT significantly outperform them, showcasing the power of deep learning in sentiment analysis and rating prediction.


# Conclusion
This NLP project provides a comprehensive exploration of machine learning models applied to restaurant reviews. By leveraging both traditional and modern techniques, the project aims to deliver accurate predictions and valuable insights from the text data. Future enhancements could involve fine-tuning models, experimenting with different embeddings, or expanding the dataset to encompass a broader range of textual information.
